# RPS BY Sharon (a-ia)

**WONDER** as you make the same three legendary choices over and over again!

**AMAZE** at the mind-blowing complexity of "Rock," "Paper," and "Scissors"!

**LOSE** when the AI somehow predicts your move.

**LAUGH** when you both pick the same thing five times in a row.

**INPUT** furiously, hoping for a *secret fourth option*. (Spoiler: there isn't one)

**MARVEL** as the AI remembers your name, tracks your defeats, and greets you like an old rival!
